docIndex = [{"index": 0, "question": "How can different animals perceive different colors ? --T-- ", "answer": "Larger animals ( including humans ) have special cells in the back of their eyes called cone cells . Each type of cone cell reacts to a specific wavelength : that is , light whose color corresponds to a specific part of the rainbow . When the cell is hit by light with the right wavelength , it sends a signal to the brain , which combines information from all of the cone types to perceive the full color range . What colors each animal sees depends on the number of different cone types , and what wavelength they react to . For example , most humans have three cell types which perceive violet , green , and yellow , but some of us lack one of these types , leading to green - red color - blindness . Some species of bird or fish on the other hand have four different cell types , giving them a very different perception of colors .", "keywords": ["different", "animals", "perceive", "different", "colors", "larger", "animals", "including", "humans", "special", "cells", "back", "eyes", "called", "cone", "cells", "type", "cone", "cell", "reacts", "specific", "wavelength", "light", "whose", "color", "corresponds", "specific", "part", "rainbow", "cell", "hit", "light", "right", "wavelength", "sends", "signal", "brain", "combines", "information", "cone", "types", "perceive", "full", "color", "range", "colors", "animal", "sees", "depends", "number", "different", "cone", "types", "wavelength", "react", "example", "humans", "three", "cell", "types", "perceive", "violet", "green", "yellow", "us", "lack", "one", "types", "leading", "green", "red", "color", "blindness", "species", "bird", "fish", "hand", "four", "different", "cell", "types", "giving", "different", "perception", "colors"]}, {"index": 1, "question": "Why are flutes classified as woodwinds when most of them are made out of metal ? --T-- ", "answer": "Contrary to what the name suggests , the difference between woodwinds and brass instruments is about how the sound is produced rather than what material they are made of . By and large , brass instruments amplify or modify the sound produced by lips vibrating against each other , while woodwinds create their own sound when wind is directed through them . This can happen by vibrating a reed in the case of oboes or clarinets , or by vibrating the air column contained within a transverse flute or a recorder , which is why they are called woodwinds .", "keywords": ["flutes", "classified", "woodwinds", "made", "metal", "contrary", "name", "suggests", "difference", "woodwinds", "brass", "instruments", "sound", "produced", "rather", "material", "made", "large", "brass", "instruments", "amplify", "modify", "sound", "produced", "lips", "vibrating", "woodwinds", "create", "sound", "wind", "directed", "happen", "vibrating", "reed", "case", "oboes", "clarinets", "vibrating", "air", "column", "contained", "within", "transverse", "flute", "recorder", "called", "woodwinds"]}, {"index": 2, "question": "How can we set a date to the beginning or end of an artistic period ?

Art historians usually try to use a major event or the creation of an art piece that features characteristics of the new period , or the death of a representative character . For example , the Baroque period is widely thought to start with the first representation of the first Baroque opera , l'Orfeo , in 1607 , and end with the death of its most famous composer , Johann Sebastian Bach , in 1750 . However , musical styles had actually started changing long before Bach passed away , and were already exhibiting features of what was to become known as the Classical period .
